            <!Documentation for your tests against another groups  client and server  including a description on what went well and what did not
                A description on how you designed the system
                A section stating who worked on what in your group
                !>

            <p>How to use the system:</p>
            <p>Download our chat client (GUI), write a name, and you're started</p>
            <p>You can type 'msg:<*names*>:message', to type to specific people.</p>
            <p>Otherwise you can just type something in, and the GUI will tell the server to write to all</p>
            <p>Type logout: to logout</p>

            <p>Without our GUI, you can call login:<*username*>, to set your name, note you can only do it once per client</p>
            <p>You can write MSG:<*receivers*>:<*message*>, where you're splitting receivers by ','s. You can write to one, many or use '*' to write to all</p>
            <p>You'll receive answers from the server in the format MSGRES:<*sender*>:<*message*>.</p>
            <p>You'll get a client list everytime a person logs off or on the server.</p>
            <p>Type 'logout:' to logout from the server </p>
